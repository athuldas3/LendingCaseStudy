loan_amnt : The listed amount of the loan applied for by the borrower. If at some point in time, the credit department reduces the loan amount, then it will be reflected in this value.

funded_amnt : The total amount committed to that loan at that point in time.

funded_amnt_inv : The total amount committed by investors for that loan at that point in time.

grade & sub_grade : Loan grading is a classification system that involves assigning a quality score to a loan based on a borrower's credit history, quality of the collateral.

verification_status : Indicates if income was verified by LC, not verified, or if the income source was verified

Generally, banks have a verification team of their own. A representative from the team is sent to the borrower's place of residence to verify the address.

desc : Loan description provided by the borrower

purpose : A category provided by the borrower for the loan request. 

title : The loan title provided by the borrower

dti ( Debt-to-Income Ratio) : A ratio calculated using the borrower’s total monthly debt payments on the total debt obligations, excluding mortgage and the requested LC loan, divided by the borrower’s self-reported monthly income. (monthly debt/monthly income) ( 28% )

delinq_2yrs : The number of 30+ days past-due incidences of delinquency in the borrower's credit file for the past 2 years (values: 0,1,2)

earliest_cr_line : The month the borrower's earliest reported credit line was opened

inq_last_6mths : The number of inquiries in past 6 months (excluding auto and mortgage inquiries)

mths_since_last_delinq : The number of months since the borrower's last delinquency.

mths_since_last_record : The number of months since the last public record.

open_acc : The number of open credit lines in the borrower's credit file.

A credit file is a collection of data about an individual's borrowing and repayment activity.
A line of credit, also known as a credit line, is an open-ended, revolving loan that a borrower may access on demand.

pub_rec : Number of derogatory public records

derogatory means showing a critical or disrespectful attitude.

revol_bal : Total credit revolving balance

A revolving loan facility is a form of credit issued by a financial institution that provides the borrower with the ability to draw down or withdraw, repay, and withdraw again

revol_util : Revolving line utilization rate, or the amount of credit the borrower is using relative to all available revolving credit.

initial_list_status : The initial listing status of the loan. Possible values are – W, F

Analysis

When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

1) Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.

Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 



2) Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)


In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.



Data cleaning:

emp_length (> 1 years) : to numbers and make it readable.
int_rate to int for analysis.
term : to month(int) & year.



Data analysis:

grade and emp title

check whether grading is correct  sub_grade 

term and delinq_2yrs(past due date 30 +days)

income and  payment status

payment_status and term.

loan amount and delinq_2yrs

home_ownership and loan_status

int_rate and recoveries

income and recoveries

total_rec_late_fee

last_credit_pull_d and recoveries

pub_rec_bankruptcies and loan amount

Questions from case study:

1) TThe data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
2) If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
3) In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
4) identify factore lead to dfault.

Operation to do:

1) remove people that are on going loan, charged off.
2) consider people that have paid emi after 3 months after not paying dor 3 months.
3) funded_amnt_inv and funded_amt should be less than loan_amnt

*Applicants who have taken a loan in the range 30k - 35k and are charged interest rate of 15-17.5 %.
*Applicants who have taken a loan for small business and the loan amount is greater than 14k.
*Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have loan of 14-16k.
*Maximum number of defaults occured when the loan was sanctioned/issued in month December.
*Loan issued in the year 2011 also defaulted more as compared to other years.
*When grade is F and loan amount is between 15k-20k.
*When employment length is 10yrs and loan amount is 12k-14k.
*For grade G and interest rate above 20%.

This can be a pretty strong driving factor for loan defaulting.
*The interest rate for charged off loans is pretty high than that of fully paid loans in all the loan_amount groups.
*Applicants who have taken a loan in the range 30k - 35k and are charged interest rate of 15-17.5 %.

*Applicants taking loan for 'home improvement' and have income of 60k -70k.
*Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have income of 60-80k.
*Across all the income groups, the loan_amount is higher for people who defaulted.
*Applicants who receive interest at the rate of 21-24% and have an income of 60k-70k.

From above plots we can see that average default rate across all categories is 14.4% and non-default rate is 85.4%.
People with experience 1 and 10 years are purchasing more loans.
Evalauation from year 2007 to 2011 the loan purchase are increasing every year.
B type grade take the lead(30.3%), followed by the A type grades(26%).
The following are the top 6 categories where maximum loan applications have been recieved and hence high is the defaulting probability in these categories.









From the above graphs we can see that people with less experience have high chance of default.
People lying in medium dti range have high chances of default
People who have high loan to annual income ratio are at high risk of defaulting.
Grades B,Cand D are at high probablity of defaulting.
